Python Case Studies
</h2>

This project is a collection of six case studies that use Python and computational techniques to analyse data, build classification models and unravel insights on multifaceted datasets. The array of topics touch on different domains of knowledge.

The theme central to these studies is the application of tools and concepts. It ranges from working with fundamental Python objects like dataframes and numpy arrays, to using advanced tools like scikit-learn. The case studies deal with different topics - working with bird migration data to learn about migration patterns, to deciphering social network dynamics among villagers, exploring diverse whisky flavors, and analyzing book data.
