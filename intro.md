Python Case Studies
</h2>

This project is a collection of six captivating case studies that use Python and computational techniques to analyse data, build classification models and unravel insights on multifaceted datasets. The array of topics touch on different domains of knowledge.

Central to these studies is the application of tools and concepts. Ranging from working with fundamental Python objects like dataframes and numpy arrays, to using advanced tools like scikit-learn. The case studies deal with different topics - working with bird migration data to untable mysteries of flight, to deciphering social network dynamics among villagers, exploring diverse whisky flavors, and analyzing book data.

This project has lead me to acquire new technical skills, develope my analytical thinking and solidify my problem-solving skills while using Python's potential to extract knowledge from diverse datasets.

Here is the table of contents:
