    Introduction
</h2>

Python Case Studies is a case study project that is the application of tools and concepts. Ranging from working with fundamental Python objects like dataframes and numpy arrays, to using advanced tools like scikit-learn. The case studies deal with different topics - working with bird migration data to unstable mysteries of flight, deciphering social network dynamics among villagers, exploring diverse whisky flavours, and analyzing book data. The main goal of this project is to use Python as a computational tool to analyse multifaceted datasets using libraries.
