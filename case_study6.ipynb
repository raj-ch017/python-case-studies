    "This case study centers around the intricate study of complex systems prevalent in both scientific and societal domains. These systems are characterized by numerous independent components, which can be effectively portrayed as networks. Within these networks, nodes symbolize indivdual components, while edges signify the interactions connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of network analysis extends to a diverse range of applications, including the examination of pathogen diffusion, behavioral dynamics, and information dissemination within social networks. Moreover, the scope of network analysis expands to encompass biological scenarios, particularly at the molecular level. This entails the exploration of gene regulation networks, signal transduction networks, protein interaction networks, and other connected systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homophily represents a characteristic of networks in which nodes that are adjacent in a network tend to share a certain attribute more frequently than nodes that are not neighbors. This case study focuses on examining the presence of homophily in various attributes among individuals connected within social networks located in rural India."
